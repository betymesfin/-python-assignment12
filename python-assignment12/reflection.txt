1) Static visualizations show fixed data and are great for reports or presentations, but they canâ€™t be explored further. 
   Interactive visualizations, on the other hand, let users zoom, filter, and explore data in real time, making insights easier to find.
2) Dashboards are powerful because they display multiple visualizations together and update instantly as new data comes in.
3) Plotly and Dash make data communication better by allowing users to interact with charts directly, customize what they see, 
   and share clear, dynamic insights in professional settings.
